My name is Hemanth Reddy Singareddy, I’m from India and currently in my final semester as a graduate student. I work as a graduate assistant in School of Business. My hobbies are reading articles, doing workouts, and listening to songs. I am passionate about technology, enjoy trying new tools and learn how they work.
## My Computer Experience
My undergraduate major was Computer Science with specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. During my academic journey, I have taken courses related to programming, data structures, databases, basics of artificial intelligence and machine learning. I have experience working with programming languages such as python, java, C, and SQL. I have worked on two projects in my undergraduate where both projects were on machine learning applications for smart homes and customer segmentation systems in automobile industry. Additionally, last year I have collaborated on research project as a graduate assistant, where I got to learn and create LLMs using Ollama, which can run on a local system, and integrate that into NLP pipeline for extracting medical entities from clinical notes.
## How I see myself using this course
I see myself applying the concepts learned in this course, create dynamic web pages and how to properly use AI, giving prompts to it so that it works how we exactly want it to. I want to create a web page on fitness tracking or make a portfolio where I want to include an AI chatbot which can help others to know more or find what they are looking for.
